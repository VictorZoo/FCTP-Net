# FCTP-Net

## Introduction

A convolutional neural network for six-category fingerprint database. This is code for our paper "*Fingerprint Pattern Identification and Classification Approach Based on Convolutional Neural Networks*", published on "*Neural Computing and Applications*".

We upload four netfiles (**Alexnet**, **Lenet**, **Caffenet** and our **FCTP-Net**). 

Hope that will be helpful for you!
