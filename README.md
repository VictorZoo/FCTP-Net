# FCTP-Net

This is a code for our paper "*Fingerprint Pattern Identification and Classification Approach Based on Convolutional Neural Networks*", published on "*Neural Computing and Applications*".

In this paper, we use a six-category fingerprint database instead four-category, which is not suitable for researching human personalities. We classified fingerprints into Arc(A), Whorl(W), Double Whorl(DW), Ulnar Loop(UL), Radial Loop(RP) and Peacock Wye(PE). Some details of datasets are as follows:

We upload four netfiles (**Alexnet**, **Lenet**, **Caffenet** and our **FCTP-Net**). 

Hope that will be helpful for you!

### Installation

We used **Caffe** framwork, you can clik [here](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe) to get the instruction for building it.
