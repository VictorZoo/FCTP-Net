# FCTP-Net

This is a code for our paper "***Fingerprint Pattern Identification and Classification Approach Based on Convolutional Neural Networks***", published on "***Neural Computing and Applications***".

In this paper, we use a six-category fingerprint database instead four-category, which is not suitable for researching human personalities. We classified fingerprints into Arc(A), Whorl(W), Double Whorl(DW), Ulnar Loop(UL), Radial Loop(RP) and Peacock Wye(PE). Some details of datasets are as follows:

We uploaded netfiles (**Alexnet**, **Lenet**, **Caffenet** and our **FCTP-Net**). 

Hope that will be helpful for you!
